During and after my first finance related Python project which was related to the topic of [analyzing ETF with Python](https://github.com/MWelHeb/02_ETF_Analysis/blob/main/ETF_Analysis.md) I came across the theme of algorithmic trading. 

Algorithmic trading, i.e. trading based on algorithm or rules (which are developed based on some trading strategy), refers to computerized, automated trading of financial instruments like stocks with little or no human intervention during trading hours. Nowadays in the U.S. stock market and many other developed financial markets, about 70-80 percent of overall trading volume is generated through algorithmic trading. Yet, in emerging economies like India, the overall trading volume of algorithmic trading is estimated to be lower at a level of ~40%. Obiously these figures are impressive and hence the topic caught my attention in terms of being a nice use case of applying and practicing Python as well quantitative methods.

In contrast to my analysis regarding ETF where I was looking at the movements of an index (i.e. bundle) of stocks (e.g. exchange traded funds such as the MSCI World, MDAX, etc.) in this algorthmic trading project the focus is more towards analyzing the price developments of a single stocks and comparing these developments across different stocks. Typical questions of interest in this case could be e.g.: 

- Which stocks have a high (intrinsic) value (e.g. in terms of future earnings, EBITDA, etc.) compared to the current stock price level, thereby indicating that the current stock price is maybe undervalued and might increase in the future? 
- How can we compare stocks in terms of their recent stock price developments and do we observe some kind of momentum within the stock price developments which might be considered as an indication/signal with regards to future stock price movements? 

Based on such ideas one could try to define certain KPIs (key performance indicators) which would form the basis for some kind of automated trading strategy. E.g. a value based trading strategy could focus on those stocks (within a pre-defined set of stocks) which have the lowest price to earings ratio or price to EBITDA ratio. On the other hand a simple momentum based trading strategy could build upon some measures regarding recent stock price returns (e.g. over the last 1 year, 6 months, 3 months, etc.) or a comparison of the current stock prices with the highest and lowest stock prices during e.g. the last year(s)/month(s). Obviously one could also think about a combination of a value and momentum trading strategy by using a combined KPI set which consistes of value and momentum based KPIs merged together according to some reasonable weighting or rule set.

To make it simple and provide an explicit case study/example: While the ETF analysis was looking at the price, return and volatility developments of e.g. the S&P 500 index we are now looking at the stock price development of each and evey ticker within the S&P 500. Thereby we try to compare these stocks with each other in order to derive and provide the basis for some kind of algorthmic trading stragegy.

Fortunately nowadays the barriers to get started with algorithmic trading are rather low:

- The internet and literature provides a large and often free source of open information and knowledge on specific finance related topcis and theories as well as know how concercing the requiredd quantitavie methodes (e.g. statistics) .
- Software in order to access and process financial data as well as to program and test the assumed trading algorithm is available for free - basically every piece of software that is needed is available in the form of open source; specifically, Python has become the language and ecosystem of choice
- Open data sources: More and more valuable online financial data sources are open and for free. These platforms moslty provide an easy, standardized access to historical and even real-time data data (via APIs)  

Again, like in any data science project the first step centers around data: Where do I get appropriate data - ideally in a very automated way and always up to date? Once an interface to the relevant data source is available much work has to be conducted around the topic of analyzing this data, i.e. data preparation, applying statistical/econometric methods, presentation and visualization of results, interpretation, etc..

The following python scripts contain the various steps of the data preparation (step 1 & 2) and analysis (step 3) which have been conducted: 

- [Data Preparation (step 1) â€“ Select a large ETF Universe](01_select_large_EFT_universe.py)
- [Data Preparation (step 2) - Generate data for selected ETFs](02_generate_ETF_universe_data_v1.py)
- [Analyze Data (step 3) - Construct a simple interactive platform to analyze/visualize selected ETFs](03_analyse_ETF.py)

A further and more detailed description of these python script is given below.

As always, the initial step is about getting data concerning the topic of interest, in this case ETF. When searching in the internet you find a large variety of potential libraries which offer an interface to financial data. E.g. one source is the library [pandas-datareader](https://pandas-datareader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) which offers access to various (financial) data sources. After some search in Google I decided to use the package [investpy](https://investpy.readthedocs.io/index.html) due to its documentation which I found helpful as well as the easy access to a wide range of ETFs in this library. According to its documentation the library investpy retrieves data from the finance portal [investing.com](https://www.investing.com/). After having installed investpy in the usual manner you can import the library and use the various functionalities to retrieve recent and historical data from indexed financial products. 

In a first step I would like to draw the attention to the following function [investpy.etfs.search_etfs(by, value)](https://investpy.readthedocs.io/_api/etfs.html?) which allows to search relevant ETF by components of its name. In that regards it might be good to know that the name of an ETF provides a large amount of information, such as issuing company (e.g. iShares, Xtrackers, etc.), index name (e.g. MSCI World, S&P 500, DAX, etc.) and regulatory aspects (e.g. UCITS) etc.. For a good explanation on this topic look for example [here](https://www.justetf.com/de/news/etf/wie-sie-etf-namen-einfach-entschluesseln.html). As you can see in the program my initial goal was to get an extract/universe of ETF which are issued by Blackrock and hence were named iShares. Moreover, I added some further attributes describing the ETF investment strategy (e.g. type of index, region, etc.). This information could also easily be obtained by scanning the ETF name for different words.

```
import investpy
import pandas as pd
from pandas import DataFrame

locpath1 = "C:/Users/Marc Wellner/01_projects/streamlit/02_finance_app/01_data/"

# Select iShare ETF
etf_univsel = investpy.etfs.search_etfs("name", "iShares")

pd.set_option('display.max_columns', 100)
print(etf_univsel)

# Export to xls
etf_univsel.to_excel(locpath1+"etf_univsel.xlsx", sheet_name='Tabelle1')
```

After having extracted this very broad datasheet of almost 2.000 different ETF from iShares which was then stored in an Excel file called etf_univsel.xlsx I did some further manual research obviously based on own ideas regarding an appropriate investment strategy (e.g. with regards to index, region, sectors, etc.). This process then led to a selection of 8 ETF which I wanted to analyze further and in more detail. These 8 ETF focus on equities (e.g. instead of bonds) and differentiate somehow by region, company size and sector (e.g. technology). Following ETF were selected:
